Flies can execute impressive aerial maneuvers in only tens of milliseconds with remarkably subtle changes to wing motion. This behavior requires a nervous system that can process and send sensory information to downstream motor effectors rapidly and efficiently. I study a specific class of neurons called descending neurons which--although relatively few in number--are solely responsible for the transmission of information from the brain to the appropriate flight motor centers in the ventral nerve cord. In order to study the descending control of flight, I use optogenetics to activate specific classes of descending neurons while measuring the resulting changes in wing kinematics as captured by three high-speed videos.

    Flies flap their wings ~200 times per second, so recording their wing motion requires a very fast camera! Above are movies recorded at 15kHz showing three different angles of the same wingbeat.
