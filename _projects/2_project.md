Praying mantises are expert hunters and one of the few insects with stereoscopic vision.  Using their excellent vision to track prey, mantises anticipate prey location and deliver a deadly strike with precision.  This project focused on understanding the motifs of hunting behavior on varying timescales and how these motifs evolve with age.
