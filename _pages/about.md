I am a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Neurobiology, advised by [Dr. Michael Dickinson](https://dickinsonlab.caltech.edu/).  My interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience, behavior, biomechanics, and machine learning.  The focus of my research centers on discovering the neural circuits that control flight.  For more details of my work, please see my [project page](/projects/1_project/) or my talk at the [COSYNE conference](https://www.youtube.com/live/ebl5bV6X9bc?si=JSyr_oSlFrt3S8sP&t=2681).  Previously, I studied motivation and learning circuits in the hippocampus and the neuromodulation of cognition at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Cornell University.  I am always interested in tackling hard problems that require interdisciplinary approaches, in particular using quantitative tools and machine learning approaches for behavioral analysis.  Outside the lab, you can find me growing [dragon fruit cacti](/assets/img/dragonfruit.png) or hiking in the San Gabriels.
