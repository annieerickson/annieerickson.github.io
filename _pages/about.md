I am a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Neurobiology, advised by [Dr. Michael Dickinson](https://dickinsonlab.caltech.edu/). My research focuses on discovering the neural circuits that control flight. My interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience, behavior, biomechanics, and machine learning.  Previously, I studied motivation and learning circuits in the hippocampus and the neuromodulation of cognition at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Cornell University.
